---

1. Search for core documentation and recent logs:
   - Identify files like `NORTH_STAR.md`, `DESIGN_CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`, `FUNCTIONAL_PRD.md`.
   - Check the `brain/` directory in the artifact path for the most recent `walkthrough.md`.

2. Synthesize the current state:
   - Read the identified documentation to understand the project's vision and current phase.
   - Review the latest `walkthrough.md` to see what was recently accomplished.

3. Outline the critical path for the current session:
   - Based on the roadmap and recent progress, identify the most impactful next steps.
   - Present a concise summary to the user and request confirmation on the priority.
