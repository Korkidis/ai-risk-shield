# AI Content Risk Score - Claude Code Guide

## Project Overview
SaaS platform for AI content risk validation. Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) + Supabase + Google Gemini 2.5 Flash + Stripe.

**Business Model:** Freemium SaaS (3 free scans/month → $29 one-time reports or $49-599/mo subscriptions)

**Core Value Prop:** Validate AI-generated images/videos for copyright risk, brand safety, and C2PA provenance in 15 seconds.

**Hybrid Billing:** Seat-based + consumption-based. Users get a set number of scans and full reports per month. Can subscribe to higher tiers or buy individual reports ($29 one-time).

## Product Strategy (Feb 2026)

### One Product Reality
- **The dashboard (`/dashboard/scans-reports`) is the product.** All roads lead here.
- **The freemium landing page is the on-ramp.** Shows immediate value (score + sample PDF), creates account, gets out of the way.
- **`/scan/[id]` is transitional.** Do NOT break it — it's still used for auto-download + verification. Deprecate only after dashboard path fully covers its functions.

### Conversion Flow (Current → Target)
**Current:** Upload → results inline → redirect to `/dashboard?scan=[id]` → magic link for persistence → `/dashboard/scans-reports` (scan auto-selected) → purchase CTAs in drawer
**Remaining:** Email gate before redirect (consent collection), instant PDF download before account creation

### Known Theater (Status)
- ~~Telemetry stream is scripted~~ — **FIXED**: Dashboard + Landing use Supabase Realtime progress (Step 7)
- ~~"3/3 REMAINING" counter is hardcoded~~ — **FIXED**: `FreeUploadContainer` fetches from `/api/scans/anonymous-quota`
- ~~Sidebar "PRO PLAN 4/10 seats" is hardcoded~~ — **FIXED**: `TenantPlanBadge` reads real billing data
- ~~Quota display "15/50_SCANS" is hardcoded~~ — **FIXED**: scans-reports reads `billingStatus.scansUsed/monthlyScanLimit`
- ~~AuditModal lies~~ — **FIXED**: Features match `plans.ts` PRO tier (Phase D)
- ~~Price inconsistency~~ — **FIXED**: `UpgradeModal.tsx` deleted, AuditModal shows $49 (Phase D)
- `FreeForensicReport.tsx` (design-lab only, not customer-facing) — cosmetic fix applied Phase E

## Critical Security Rules

### Data Protection
- **ALWAYS use Row Level Security (RLS)** on every database query
- **NEVER expose PII** in logs, URLs, or error messages
- **ALWAYS encrypt brand guidelines** before storing (AES-256) — NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, schema ready
- **NEVER use localStorage for auth** - httpOnly cookies only (Supabase handles this)
- **ALWAYS verify tenant_id** server-side (don't trust client)

### API Security
- **API routes pattern:** Check auth → verify tenant_id → check quota → process request
- **Service role key:** Server-side only, NEVER expose to client
- **Anon key:** Client-side only, limited permissions
- **Input validation:** Sanitize all user inputs (file names, emails, etc.)
- **`/api/scans/process` auth + idempotency added** — validates origin and rejects duplicate processing (S1 fixed)

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
- **Every table must have tenant_id** column with RLS policy
- **Test cross-tenant access** after every feature (should always fail)
- **Quota enforcement:** Use atomic database function (prevent race conditions)

## Architecture Principles

### Next.js 16 App Router
- **Server Components by default** - Use "use client" only when needed (useState, useEffect, browser APIs)
- **Server Actions** for mutations (no need for API routes for simple forms)
- **API routes** for complex workflows (file upload, Gemini analysis)

### Supabase Best Practices
- **Three client types:**
  - `createBrowserClient` - Client Components
  - `createServerClient` - Server Components, API Routes
  - Middleware client - Session refresh
- **RLS is defense-in-depth** - Always filter by tenant_id in code too
- **Storage paths:** Always use tenant_id in folder structure (`uploads/{tenant_id}/{file}`)
- **Realtime** - Switched from polling to Supabase Realtime (Feb 2026) for scan status updates. Polling caused 139GB egress.

### Gemini API Usage
- **Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash` — verify metadata stores this, not `gemini-1.5-flash`
- **Safety blocks = feature, not bug** - Convert to critical finding (score: 100)
- **Three separate calls:** Legal Analyst (IP) + Compliance Auditor (Safety) + Report Generator
- **Temperature:** 0.2 for analysis (consistent), 0.4 for reports (creative)
- **Never send PII** - Only image data, no user emails/names

### Risk Scoring (Canonical)
- **Single source of truth:** `lib/risk/tiers.ts` and `lib/risk/scoring.ts` (40 unit tests, commit 7ff1e83)
- **5 tiers:** critical / high / review / caution / safe
- **C2PA fidelity:** 5-value system (verified / caution / untrusted / invalid / missing)
- **Composite formula:** Weighted (IP 70%, Provenance 20%, Safety 10%) with Red Flag override at ≥85
- **Do NOT add local thresholds anywhere** — always use `getRiskTier()` from `lib/risk/tiers.ts`

### Authentication
- **Password-based:** signup + login via Server Actions
- **Magic link (freemium):** Shadow user creation via `supabase.auth.admin.createUser()` + `generateLink()`, delivered via Resend
- **Legacy:** Custom `magic_links` table dropped (migration `20260208_cleanup_magic_links.sql` applied Phase P). Verify route and `app/auth/verify/` directory already deleted (Phase E).

### Stripe Integration
- **5-tier pricing:** FREE / PRO ($49) / TEAM ($199) / AGENCY ($499) / ENTERPRISE (custom) — see `lib/plans.ts`
- **Two purchase paths:** One-time $29 report per scan OR monthly/annual subscription
- **Metered overage billing:** Stripe Usage Records for paid plans exceeding monthly limits
- **Webhook handler:** `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` processes `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
- **Plan sync:** `applyPlanToTenant()` syncs all limits and feature flags from `lib/plans.ts` to tenant record
- **Entitlements:** `lib/entitlements.ts` centralizes access control (`canViewFullReport`, `canViewTeaser`, `isQuotaExceeded`)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't trust client-side validation** - Always re-validate server-side
❌ **Don't forget audit logging** - Log all sensitive actions (scans, purchases, data access)
❌ **Don't expose stack traces** - Generic errors to users, detailed logs server-side
❌ **Don't use sequential IDs** - Use UUIDs (prevent enumeration attacks)
❌ **Don't store Stripe card data** - Stripe handles it, we only store customer IDs
❌ **Don't block paid users at quota** - Allow overages, bill automatically
❌ **Don't add hardcoded risk thresholds** - Use `lib/risk/tiers.ts` exclusively
❌ **Don't create duplicate analysis pipelines** - Route all flows through the same processor (FIXED: unified in Phase A)
❌ **Don't reconstruct data you already stored** - Read the `risk_profile` blob from scans table

## Testing Checklist (Run After Each Feature)

- [ ] Upload image → verify scores appear
- [ ] Upload video as free user → verify blocked
- [ ] Upload video as paid user → verify dynamic frame count per plan tier
- [ ] Hit quota limit (free) → verify upgrade modal
- [ ] Hit quota limit (paid) → verify overage allowed
- [ ] Cross-tenant test → verify can't access other tenant's data
- [ ] Invalid file upload → verify helpful error message
- [ ] Anonymous upload → verify session tracking and scan assignment
- [ ] Email gate → verify shadow user creation and magic link delivery
- [ ] $29 one-time purchase → verify Stripe checkout → webhook → scan.purchased = true
- [ ] Subscription purchase → verify plan applied to tenant
- [ ] Upload video exceeding plan duration → verify 413 `VIDEO_DURATION_EXCEEDED`
- [ ] View video frame analysis in drawer → verify `VideoFrameGrid` renders
- [ ] View audit logs as AGENCY+ user → verify page loads
- [ ] View audit logs as PRO user → verify upgrade prompt
- [ ] Invite team member as TEAM+ owner → verify email sent + invite listed
- [ ] Invitee clicks magic link → verify joins inviter's tenant (not stray tenant)
- [ ] Hit seat limit → verify 403 with descriptive error

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables
- `tenants` - Organizations (stores plan/quota/Stripe IDs, `stripe_metered_item_id` for overage)
- `profiles` - Links auth.users to tenants (role: owner/admin/member)
- `assets` - Uploaded file metadata (path, checksum, size, `session_id` for anonymous)
- `scans` - Analysis records (scores, risk level, status, `risk_profile` JSON blob, `session_id`, `purchased`, `purchase_type`, `share_token`, `share_expires_at`)
- `scan_findings` - Detailed findings (type, severity, description, confidence_score)
- `video_frames` - Frame-by-frame analysis for videos
- `brand_profiles` - Custom brand guidelines (encryption NOT yet implemented)
- `usage_ledger` - Quota tracking (atomic increment)
- `subscriptions` - Stripe subscription cache
- `audit_log` - Security audit trail (append-only)
- `mitigation_reports` - AI-generated remediation guidance (schema exists)
- `referral_events` - Insurance referral tracking (schema exists)
- `tenant_invites` - Team invite tokens (schema exists, `metadata` column confirmed in live DB)

### Pending Schema Drift
Two migrations created but NOT applied to live DB:
- `20260211_add_tenant_invites_metadata.sql`
- `20260211_add_tenant_switch_audit_created_at_index.sql` (CONCURRENTLY — must run outside transaction)

Note: User reported applying these + the Feb 15 migrations (`risk_profile_blob`, `fix_scan_assignment`, `cleanup_shadow_users_rpc`, `enable_realtime_scans`) on Feb 16. Verify in Supabase dashboard if uncertain.

### Every Table Must Have
- `id` (UUID primary key)
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `tenant_id` (UUID, foreign key, indexed) - *except auth tables*
- RLS policies enabled

## Video Processing Rules

- **Paid tiers only** - Check plan before allowing upload (`videoMaxDurationSeconds > 0`)
- **Dynamic frame count per plan tier** - Configured via `PlanConfig.videoFrameLimit`:
  | Tier | Max Duration | Frames |
  |------|-------------|--------|
  | FREE | 0 (blocked) | 0 |
  | PRO | 120s (2min) | 5 |
  | TEAM | 300s (5min) | 10 |
  | AGENCY | 600s (10min) | 15 |
  | ENTERPRISE | 600s (10min) | 15 |
- **Duration enforcement** - `getVideoDuration()` via ffprobe at upload, compared against `videoMaxDurationSeconds`
- **Size cap** - 250MB max for video uploads (memory safety on serverless)
- **Aggregate scores** - Use MAX(all frame scores), not average
- **Frame persistence** - Frames stored to `uploads/{tenant_id}/frames/{scanId}/frame_XXX.jpg` in Supabase Storage
- **Frame retrieval** - `/api/scans/[id]/frames` returns signed URLs + per-frame scores
- **Storage cleanup** - Both retention scripts delete frame files before parent scan/asset
- **Enterprise capped same as Agency** - No worker/queue, Vercel function timeout makes longer video unsafe

## Quota Enforcement

```typescript
// CORRECT - Atomic server-side check
const { allowed, usage, remaining } = await consumeQuota(tenantId, 1);
if (!allowed && plan === 'free') {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'quota_exceeded' });
}
// For paid plans, allow overage (will bill automatically)
```

## Deployment Notes

- **Platform:** Vercel (automatic Next.js optimization)
- **Database:** Supabase (hosted PostgreSQL)
- **CDN:** Vercel Edge Network (automatic)
- **Region:** US East (iad1) - or closest to target users
- **Environment:** Separate env vars for preview vs production

## Known Issues (Current as of Feb 17, 2026)

### Pipeline Unified (Phase A Complete)
Both authenticated and anonymous paths now route through `lib/ai/scan-processor.ts`. C2PA runs for all scans. `/api/analyze` (legacy sync endpoint) has been deleted.

### Data Handoff — Fixed
`GET /api/scans/[id]` now reads the stored `risk_profile` JSONB blob directly. Legacy fallback still exists for pre-blob scans (reconstructs from individual columns). RSFindingsDossier and ProvenanceTelemetryStream now consume real Gemini data.

### Brand Guidelines — Wired (Phase F)
Upload API extracts `guidelineId` from formData, validates tenant ownership, stores `guideline_id` on scan record. Scan processor fetches the guideline and passes it to `analyzeImageMultiPersona()`. Dashboard has guideline selector dropdown (only shows if user has created guidelines). Video pipeline guidelines deferred (needs per-frame prompt injection).

### Phase D Complete (Feb 17, 2026)
- Entitlements enforced in scans-reports drawer (gated findings, sample vs full PDF via `Entitlements.canViewFullReport()`)
- Share button wired: API call → clipboard copy → animated toast
- AuditModal rendering with real Stripe checkout buttons (`OneTimePurchaseButton` + `UpgradeButton`)
- Bulk download/share wired in `RSBulkActionBar`
- Dead code deleted: `ScanResultsWithGate.tsx`, `UpgradeModal.tsx`; design-lab updated to use `AuditModal`

### Phase E Complete (Feb 17, 2026)
- C2PA serial placeholder replaced with runtime extraction + deterministic hash fallback (`lib/c2pa.ts`)
- CLAUDE.md Known Theater section updated — all 6 items resolved
- Video frame count docs aligned with code (5 for MVP)
- FreeForensicReport.tsx cosmetic fix ($49, "50 scans/mo")

### Phase F Complete (Feb 18, 2026)
- Brand guidelines wired end-to-end: upload API validates + stores `guideline_id`, scan processor fetches + passes to Gemini
- Dashboard scanner has guideline selector dropdown (hidden when no guidelines exist)
- Conversion flow docs updated to reflect actual `LandingClient.tsx` redirect behavior
- All three Gemini personas (IP, Safety, Provenance) now receive custom brand rules via `formatGuidelineRules()`

### Phase G Complete (Feb 18, 2026)
- `types/database.ts` drift fixed: added `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `user_id` to ExtendedScan; fixed plan type `'individual'`→`'pro'`; `guideline_id` nullable
- Status API (`/api/scans/[id]/status`) now returns real `risk_profile` blob when scan is complete
- `FreeUploadContainer.tsx` uses real Gemini risk_profile (falls back to constructed one for legacy scans)
- Webhook `listUsers()` hardened: retry profile query after 1s delay, paginated fallback (`perPage: 50`)
- Webhook profile polling increased from 1.5s (3×500ms) to 5s (5×1000ms) for trigger resilience

### Phase H Complete (Feb 18, 2026)
- **Share token validation wired end-to-end**: GET `/api/scans/[id]` validates `?token=` against `share_token` + `share_expires_at`; tokens stripped from response
- **Public shared scan page**: `/scan/[id]?token=` renders `SharedScanView` with `RSRiskPanel`, `RSFindingsDossier`, asset preview, CTA footer; no-token redirects to dashboard
- **ExtendedTenant type sync**: Added 20 missing fields (limits, overage costs, feature flags, Stripe IDs) matching webhook `applyPlanToTenant()`
- **ProvenanceDetails fix**: `hashing_algorithm` now optional (DB default, never explicitly written)
- **Error/not-found pages**: Root `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, dashboard `error.tsx` — all using RS design system components

### Phase I Complete (Feb 19, 2026)
- **Share link bug fixed**: `handleShare` was reading `data.share_token` but PATCH returns `{ scan: updatedScan }` — fixed to `data.scan.share_token`
- **billing.ts `as any` removed**: Cast replaced with `Pick<ExtendedTenant, ...>` for real type safety
- **Soft gate data leak fixed**: `scan_findings` descriptions were returned in full for unauthenticated viewers — now masked with "Unlock full report to view details." (titles/severity preserved as teasers)
- **Provenance masking gap fixed**: `provenance_report.reasoning` was not masked in the soft gate while IP and safety reports were — now masked consistently
- **Supabase types note**: `lib/supabase/types.ts` is stale (still has old column names) — causes `as any` casts across the codebase. Run `supabase gen types typescript` against live DB to regenerate.

### Phase J Complete (Feb 19, 2026)
- **sort_by injection fixed**: `/api/scans/list` now whitelists allowed sort fields (`created_at`, `composite_score`, `risk_level`, `status`) — prevents injection via `.order()`
- **Anonymous quota fail-closed**: `/api/scans/anonymous-quota` now returns `{ allowed: false }` with 503 when quota service errors (was fail-open with `allowed: true`)
- **Process route timing-safe auth**: Service role key comparison uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` instead of `===`
- **File size validation**: Both upload endpoints enforce 100MB image / 500MB video limits with 413 response
- **Email validation**: `capture-email` now uses proper regex (`/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`) instead of simple `@` check
- **SHA-256 checksums**: Upload routes compute real checksums from file buffer instead of storing `'pending'`
- **Error message leak fixed**: Upload and process routes no longer expose raw `error.message` to clients

### Phase K Complete (Feb 19, 2026)
- **Cross-tenant fix**: Guidelines DELETE dependency check now filters by `tenant_id` — was querying all tenants' scans
- **Error detail leaks sealed**: `create-checkout`, `switch-tenant` (×2), `upload` (storage + asset), `anonymous-upload` (storage + asset) no longer expose raw `error.message`/`details`/`code` to clients
- **PII scrubbed from logs**: Removed email addresses from `console.log` in capture-email, webhook (×4), auth actions, auth callback — replaced with user IDs
- **sortOrder validated**: `/api/scans/list` now validates `sort_order` to only accept `'asc'`/`'desc'` (was missed in Phase J sort_by whitelist)
- **Referrer policy**: `/scan/[id]` exports `metadata.referrer = 'no-referrer'` to prevent share token leakage via Referer header

### Phase L Complete (Feb 19, 2026)
- **Scan session hijacking fixed**: `capture-email` now validates `scanId` belongs to current `session_id` before attaching email — was allowing cross-session scan theft
- **UUID validation**: `capture-email` validates `scanId` format (UUID v4 regex) before database queries
- **Anonymous video blocked**: `anonymous-upload` now returns 403 for video uploads — per business model, video analysis requires paid plan
- **Pagination wired**: `/api/scans/list` accepts `page` and `limit` query params, uses `.range()` instead of `.limit(50)`, returns `{ page, limit, hasMore }` metadata

### Phase M Complete (Feb 19, 2026)
- **Free-tier video blocked (authenticated)**: `/api/scans/upload` now checks `plan === 'free'` and returns 403 for video uploads — was only blocked for anonymous users
- **increment_scans_used RPC replaced**: Non-existent RPC call replaced with direct `.update({ scans_used_this_month: used + 1 })` — was silently failing
- **Cookie maxAge reduced**: `magic_auth_email` cookie reduced from 7 days to 24 hours to minimize exposure window
- **Scan processor race guard**: `processScan()` now checks scan status before processing — skips if already in terminal state (`complete`/`failed`) to prevent duplicate analysis
- **Error detail leak sealed**: Upload route `scanError.message` no longer exposed to clients in scan creation failure response

### Phase N Complete (Feb 20, 2026)
- **Stripe webhook idempotency**: Event IDs tracked in-memory Set — duplicate events from Stripe retries are now skipped (prevents double charges, duplicate user creation)
- **NaN-safe pagination**: `parseInt` calls in `/api/scans/list` now have `|| fallback` after radix 10 — prevents `NaN` offset from empty string params
- **JSON.parse safety**: `guidelines/extract` now catches malformed Gemini JSON responses with 422 instead of unhandled exception
- **Security headers**: Added `Permissions-Policy` (camera/mic/geo disabled) and `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none` to `next.config.js`
- **Stripe checkout input validation**: `planId` validated against whitelist (`pro/team/agency`), `interval` validated against `monthly/annual`, price config `details` leak removed
- **guidelineId UUID validation**: Upload route now validates UUID format before querying DB — prevents wasted queries on malformed input
- **PII scrubbed from scan access logs**: `scans/[id]` debug logs no longer expose user IDs, tenant IDs, or scan IDs

### Phase O Complete (Feb 20, 2026)
- **Open redirect fixed (CRITICAL)**: Middleware `next` param and auth callback `next` param now validated — must start with `/` and not `//` to prevent `//evil.com` redirect attacks
- **Webhook metadata validated**: `handleCheckoutCompleted` now validates `scanId` (UUID format) and `purchaseType` (`one_time`/`subscription`) before processing — prevents malformed metadata from corrupting data
- **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header**: Added `same-origin` to prevent cross-origin window reference attacks (Spectre-class)
- **Switch-tenant fail-fast**: Missing `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` env vars now throw at module load instead of silently failing at request time
- **Session cookie expiry reduced**: Anonymous session cookie reduced from 30 days to 7 days to minimize exposure window

### Phase P Complete (Feb 22, 2026)
- **Monthly quota reset implemented**: Hybrid approach — Vercel Cron (`/api/cron/reset-quotas`) resets free tenants on 1st of each month; Stripe `invoice.paid` webhook resets paid tenants on billing cycle
- **Stripe usage reporting retry**: Failed reports written to `failed_usage_reports` table; Vercel Cron retries every 15 min with exponential backoff (5m→15m→45m→2h→6h); alerts on max-attempt exhaustion
- **Stripe customer ID stored on all webhook paths**: `handleSubscriptionUpdated`, `handleSubscriptionCanceled`, and one-time purchase path now all persist `stripe_customer_id` (was only subscription checkout)
- **Webhook health alerting**: `lib/webhook-monitor.ts` writes failures to `audit_log` table + optional email alerts via Resend (`WEBHOOK_ALERT_EMAIL` env var). Instrumented: signature failures, plan apply errors, scan purchase failures, anonymous user resolution errors
- **Stripe price ID validation**: Lazy validation on first checkout request via `lib/stripe-validate-prices.ts` — validates all configured `STRIPE_PRICE_*` env vars against Stripe API, caches result, logs errors
- **Legacy magic_links table dropped**: Migration `20260208_cleanup_magic_links.sql` applied
- **Vercel Cron configured**: `vercel.json` with two cron jobs (monthly quota reset + 15-min usage retry)

### Phase R Complete (Feb 24, 2026)
- **Supabase types rebuilt**: `lib/supabase/types.ts` manually reconstructed from schema mapping (18 tables, 6 RPCs, `rate_limits` table added). Includes `Relationships: []` on all tables, `Views`, `CompositeTypes` for Supabase-js compatibility. `scans.status` and `scans.risk_level` narrowed to union types.
- **`as any` casts eliminated**: Reduced from 107 → 8 legitimate casts (external libraries: C2PA, Stripe, React email, Next.js request). Zero `@ts-ignore` comments in app/lib/components.
- **Type-check zero errors**: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors. `types/database.ts` reconciled with regenerated types (`file_size` added to `ScanWithRelations`, `BrandGuideline` arrays made nullable).
- **`scans/[id]/route.ts` refactored**: Introduced `ScanApiResult` local type for dynamic select casts (replaces 6 `as any` and `NonNullable<typeof>` workarounds). Legacy fallback uses clean spread instead of `delete` mutations.
- **Rate limiting added to 6 endpoints**: Generic `checkRateLimit()` in `lib/ratelimit.ts` backed by `rate_limits` Supabase table (sliding-window + optional progressive block). Fail-open on DB errors.
  - `signUp`: 5/15min per IP
  - `login`: 5/15min per IP, 1-hour block after exhaustion
  - `requestPasswordReset`: 3/1hr per IP
  - `capture-email` (magic link): 5/1hr per IP → 429 with `Retry-After`
  - `upload`: 10/1min per tenant → 429 with `Retry-After`
  - `create-checkout`: 5/1hr per user (or IP if anonymous) → 429 with `Retry-After`
- **Migration**: `20260224_rate_limits.sql` — `rate_limits` table with unique `(key, action)` index, RLS enabled (service role only), `cleanup_stale_rate_limits()` RPC for pruning

### Sprint 10 + 10.5 Complete (Mar 3, 2026)
- **Entitlement model corrected**: Scan reports are FREE (email-gated for anonymous, open for authenticated). $29 buys MITIGATION reports (remediation plan, bias audit, compliance matrix). `canViewFullReport()` renamed to `canViewScanReport()` — returns true for any authenticated same-tenant user or anonymous with matching session.
- **Mitigation purchase path created**: `MitigationPurchaseButton` → Stripe checkout with `purchaseType: 'mitigation'` → webhook creates `mitigation_reports` row → generation route picks up `pending` row and generates
- **AuditModal redesigned**: Sells mitigation reports ($29 one-time or Pro subscription credits), not scan reports
- **Server-side unlock fixed**: `capture-email` persists email to scan record; `/api/scans/[id]` masking lifts when `scan.email` present. Email persistence failure is fatal (500).
- **Atomic mitigation credits**: `consume_mitigation_quota()` RPC with `FOR UPDATE` lock + check + increment in single PG transaction. Replaces TOCTOU-prone separate read + increment.
- **CAS enforcement on status transitions**: Both `pending→processing` and `failed→processing` transitions use `.select('id')` + zero-row check to prevent double-generation from concurrent requests
- **Mitigation generator extracted**: `lib/ai/mitigation-generator.ts` with `generateMitigationReport()` and `generateMitigationPdf()`
- **PDF gating corrected**: In-app scan report downloads are always full (`isSample = false`). Sample PDFs only in pre-account email.
- **Quota boundary hardened**: `v_new_used + p_amount > limit` (correct for bulk amounts)

### Sprint 11 Complete (Mar 14, 2026)
- **Rebrand**: "AI Risk Shield" → "AI Content Risk Score" across all customer-facing UI, metadata, emails, PDFs, navbars
- **Video production-readiness**: Plan-tier video config (`videoMaxDurationSeconds`, `videoFrameLimit` on `PlanConfig`). Dynamic frame count from tenant plan. `getVideoDuration()` via ffprobe for upload-time enforcement. Duration + 250MB size limits at upload. Frame persistence to Supabase Storage. Frames API (`/api/scans/[id]/frames`). `VideoFrameGrid` component wired into `UnifiedScanDrawer`. Frame cleanup in both retention scripts. Enhanced realtime progress with `frameData`.
- **Audit log viewer**: `/api/audit-logs` API (paginated, filterable by action/resource/date). `/dashboard/audit-logs` page + `AuditLogClient.tsx`. AGENCY+ feature gate. Conditional sidebar nav.
- **Team management**: Auth callback invite-aware provisioning (prevents stray tenant on invited user's first login). Partial unique index on `(tenant_id, lower(email)) WHERE accepted_at IS NULL`. `/api/team/invite` + `/api/team/members` + `/api/team/invites` APIs. `/dashboard/team` page + `TeamClient.tsx` with seat gauge, role management, invite modal. TEAM+ feature gate. Conditional sidebar nav.
- **CI pipeline**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — lint → type-check → vitest → build on PR/push to main
- **Unit tests**: 94 tests passing (13 plans-video + 41 entitlements + 40 risk scoring)
- **Lint cleanup**: 111 errors → 0 errors (17 legitimate warnings: Next.js error boundaries, React hooks deps, design system `<img>` elements)
- **Type safety**: Zero `tsc --noEmit` errors maintained

### Sprint 12 Complete (Mar 14, 2026)
- **Findings liberated from scroll constraint**: Dashboard right pane restructured from proportional flex (`flex-[1.3]` + `flex-1`) to natural-height scroll unit (`shrink-0` + parent `overflow-y-auto`). `RSFindingsDossier` inner `overflow-y-auto` and `flex-1` removed — all findings render at full height, no inner scrollbar.
- **Mitigation CTA elevated to sticky footer**: Extracted `MitigationCTA` from scrollable section in `UnifiedScanDrawer` → `shrink-0` footer with `backdrop-blur-md` between scroll area and `</motion.div>`, always visible without scrolling.
- **Telemetry de-theatered**: All 12 provenance row labels humanized in both `dashboard/page.tsx` and `ProvenanceTelemetryStream.tsx` (`MANIFEST_STORE` → `CONTENT_ORIGIN`, `CHAIN_OF_CUSTODY` → `EDIT_CHAIN`, `CLAIM_SIGNATURE` → `DIGITAL_SIGNATURE`, etc.). Values use plain language (`VERIFIED`, `INTACT`, `NOT DETECTED`). Loading states use real dimension names instead of `SCANNING_SECTOR_N`. Header/footer theater removed (`BRAVO-RACK-09`, `Buffer: Ready` → `Content Credentials`, `Status: Active`).
- **Secret sauce scrubbed**: Removed `Google Gemini 2.5 Flash`, exact scoring weights (70/20/10%), temperature settings (`0.2`), agent architecture (`three specialized system prompts`), `c2pa-node` library reference, and unit test counts from all customer-facing UI (landing, dashboard, help, design-lab). Replaced with `AI-Powered Analysis`, `weighted blend`, `three independent dimensions`.
- **Placeholder theater killed**: `Analyst_Notes` → `Compliance_Log`, `// START_KEYBOARD_STREAM...` → natural placeholder text. `ViT-H/14` model reference removed from design-lab. `MODEL_VERSION` → `ANALYSIS_ENGINE` (all occurrences).
- **Telemetry panel hardened**: `SYS.09` dimmed to `text-white/10`. Footer changed from hardcoded `Cryptographic Seal Verified` → conditional `Provenance Verified` / `No Provenance Data` based on actual `CONTENT_ORIGIN` row status in real data.
- **All 5 pending DB migrations applied**: `rate_limits`, `harden_rate_limits`, `atomic_mitigation_usage`, `atomic_mitigation_quota`, `team_invites_unique_constraint` — schema drift fully resolved.

### Pending Schema Drift (Updated Mar 14 — Sprint 12)
All previously pending migrations have been applied to the live DB:
- ✅ `20260224_rate_limits.sql` — rate_limits table + cleanup function
- ✅ `20260228_harden_rate_limits.sql` — atomic `check_rate_limit_atomic()` fn
- ✅ `20260302_atomic_mitigation_usage.sql` — `increment_tenant_mitigation_usage()` RPC
- ✅ `20260303_atomic_mitigation_quota.sql` — `consume_mitigation_quota()` atomic RPC
- ✅ `20260314_team_invites_unique_constraint.sql` — partial unique index on pending invites

No pending schema drift as of Mar 14, 2026.

## Lessons Learned (Updated as we build)

### Step 1: Next.js Initialization (2026-01-03)
- **Tailwind CSS v4 requires `@tailwindcss/postcss`** instead of the old `tailwindcss` PostCSS plugin
- PostCSS config must use `'@tailwindcss/postcss': {}` not `tailwindcss: {}`
- Next.js 16 uses Turbopack by default (much faster builds)
- TypeScript strict mode catches errors early - keep it enabled
- Always use `npm run type-check` before committing

### Step 2: Supabase Setup (2026-01-03)
- **Initial migrations must be run manually in SQL Editor** - Supabase doesn't expose `exec_sql` RPC by default
- **Storage policies require tenant_id from profiles** - Use `auth.uid()` to get user, then lookup `tenant_id`
- **Three separate Supabase clients needed:** browser (anon), server (anon or service role), middleware (session refresh)
- **Service role key bypasses RLS** - Only use for admin operations (Stripe webhooks, background jobs)
- **RLS helper function** - Created `public.user_tenant_id()` (not `auth.` - permission issue) for easy tenant filtering in policies
- **Atomic quota function** - Uses `FOR UPDATE` row locking to prevent race conditions

### Step 3: Authentication Flow (2026-01-03)
- **Server Actions for auth** - signup, login, logout all server-side (secure, no API routes needed)
- **Atomic tenant creation** - Signup creates user + tenant + profile in transaction
- **First user = owner** - Role automatically set to 'owner' for first user in tenant
- **Middleware protects routes** - Auto-redirect to login if accessing /dashboard without auth

### Step 4: Stripe Billing (2026-01-22 - 2026-02-01)
- **5-tier plan config is source of truth** (`lib/plans.ts`) — webhooks sync to tenant record
- **Metered billing uses Stripe Usage Records** — not manual invoice items
- **One-time purchases mark `scan.purchased = true`** — entitlements check this field
- **Overage pricing is deliberately punishing on PRO** ($2.50/scan) to drive TEAM upgrades

### Step 5: Freemium + Magic Links (2026-02-01)
- **Shadow user creation** via `supabase.auth.admin.createUser()` with `email_confirm: false`
- **Magic link** via `supabase.auth.admin.generateLink()` — not the legacy custom `magic_links` table
- **Cookie-based instant access** — `magic_auth_email` httpOnly cookie for UX before email click
- **Scalability issue fixed** — `capture-email/route.ts` now uses `createUser()` + catch instead of `listUsers()`

### Step 6: Risk Model Unification (2026-02-11)
- **Canonical tiers and scoring** in `lib/risk/tiers.ts` and `lib/risk/scoring.ts`
- **40 unit tests** confirm zero level shifts after unification
- **C2PA 5-value fidelity** — verified / caution / untrusted / invalid / missing
- **Do NOT use local threshold constants** — always import from `lib/risk/tiers.ts`

### Step 7: Realtime (2026-02-05)
- **Switched from polling to Supabase Realtime** — polling caused 139GB egress and image flickering
- **Channel subscriptions** in `hooks/useRealtimeScans.ts` for live scan status updates
