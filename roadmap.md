> This file previously contained a Phase 1/2/3/4 roadmap that diverged from the actual execution plan.
> It was retired on 2026-02-15 to eliminate planning confusion.

> For high-level vision and product strategy, see [`NORTH_STAR.md`](NORTH_STAR.md).
> For what to build next, see [`tasks/todo.md`](tasks/todo.md).
> For honest state of the product, see [`brain/walkthrough.md`](brain/walkthrough.md).
