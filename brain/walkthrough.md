# Sprint 7-9 Walkthrough

## Sprint 7 — UI Coherence (`4950eb1`)
UnifiedScanDrawer, ScanCard extraction, trust claims, detail fetch, lint clean.

## Sprint 8 — Scans Page Fixes (`79e1d44` + `665526c`)
| Item | Implementation |
|------|---------------|
| Real delete | `handleDrawerDelete` → `DELETE /api/scans/${id}` + optimistic UI |
| Server search | List route: UUID → `eq`, filename → post-query filter |
| Server sort/filter | `sort_by`/`sort_order`/`risk_level` params, sort dropdown |
| Realtime refetch | `handleScanUpdate` fetches detail on `status === 'complete'` |
| Video risk_profile | Structured blob matching image schema, saved to DB |
| Empty states | Upload CTA (zero scans) + Clear Filters (no results) |
| Stabilization | Lightweight list query (removed heavy joins), better error visibility |

## Sprint 9 — Mitigation Report Pipeline

### 9.1 API Route
[mitigation/route.ts](file:///Users/lastknowngood/Documents/Projects/ai-risk-sheild/app/api/scans/[id]/mitigation/route.ts)

`POST /api/scans/[id]/mitigation` with 5 guardrails:
1. **Idempotency** — returns existing `complete` (200) or `processing` (202) report
2. **Failure handling** — always sets `status='failed'` on Gemini errors
3. **Atomic credits** — `consume_quota` RPC with direct-update fallback
4. **Schema alignment** — Gemini prompt produces `MitigationReportContent` schema
5. **API contract** — `{ code, message, report?, cached?, creditsRemaining? }`

### 9.2 Drawer CTA Wiring
[page.tsx](file:///Users/lastknowngood/Documents/Projects/ai-risk-sheild/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/scans-reports/page.tsx#L715-L753) — Optimistic UI: immediately shows `processing` state, merges completed report, handles 202/402/errors with toast feedback.

### 9.3 Report Display
[UnifiedScanDrawer.tsx](file:///Users/lastknowngood/Documents/Projects/ai-risk-sheild/components/dashboard/UnifiedScanDrawer.tsx#L449-L548) — Renders when `latestMitigation.status === 'complete'`:
- Executive summary with decision badge (clear/watch/hold/block)
- Domain analyses (IP, Safety, Provenance) with severity + exposures
- Mitigation action plan (priority, domain, owner, effort, verification)
- Residual risk with publish decision + conditions

## Verification

| Check | S7 | S8 | S9 |
|-------|----|----|-----|
| `tsc --noEmit` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| ESLint errors | 0 | 0 | 0 (Excluding legacy `any` types) |

## Sprint 9 — Pre-Launch QA + Polish
*(Follow-on to Mitigation Report Pipeline)*

### 9.4 Bug Fixes & Enforcements
- **PDF Finding Leak Fix:** Masked non-hero sample finding descriptions in `lib/pdf-generator.ts` to prevent data leaks for anonymous users.
- **Scan Ownership Check:** Added strict `session_id` ownership checks in `api/stripe/create-checkout/route.ts` to prevent cross-tenant/cross-user purchase exploitation.
- **Stripe Cache TTL:** Verified and tuned standard price caching logic.
- **Guideline Validation:** Ensured `api/scans/upload/route.ts` warns or handles unresolvable UUID guidelines appropriately.

### 9.5 Quota & Notification Wiring
- **UI Quota Sync:** Exposed real-time `scansUsed / monthlyScanLimit` inside the `TenantPlanBadge` (sidebar) and Scans & Reports header utilizing existing `billing.ts` action and updated DB schema columns.
- **Sample PDF Magic Link Attachment:** Upgraded `api/scans/capture-email/route.ts` to generate the PDF buffer `< 5MB` and pass it to Resend in `sendSampleReportEmail` along with the authentication link.

### 9.6 ESLint & Stability
- Refactored `useRealtimeScans.ts` to solve critical React strict mode side-effects (cannot access ref values over ongoing renders, exhaustive dependency arrays).
- Refactored `RSTelemetryPanel.tsx` preventing cascading re-renders caused by synchronous `setState` in tight initial `<boot|scanning|grid>` loops.
- `tsc --noEmit` clears fully. Smoke test scripts confirm mitigation + tenant changes are active in Postgres schema.
