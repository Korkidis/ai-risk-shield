# AI Risk Shield: Design Principles & Context

## 0. Prime Directive: Reuse & Component Integrity
**Check for existing components first.** Before creating a new UI element, the agent/developer MUST verify if an existing component (`components/rs/*`) can be used or adapted.
*   **Reuse > Create**: We prioritize consistency. Unnecessary duplication dilutes the design system.
*   **Solve the Problem**: If an existing component *cannot* solve the problem, creating a new one or a duplicate is acceptable. Do not block progress for purity.
*   **Do Not Delete**: Avoid aggressive refactoring or deletion of "duplicate" components unless explicitly instructed. We limit duplicates, but we do not break working code to remove them.

## 1. Core Philosophy: "The Forensic Instrument"
The interface is not a "web app" but a **precision instrument**. It draws inspiration from mid-century German industrial design (Dieter Rams for Braun) and cold-war era avionics. It favors **physicality, clarity, and mechanical feedback** over fleeting digital trends.

### **Axiom 1: Materiality is Truth**
*   **The Chassis**: The background is not "white" but **Clay White (`#EBE7E0`)**, representing an injection-molded ABS plastic housing.
*   **The Parting Line**: Every distinct component must have a "parting line" (highlight top-left, shadow bottom-right) to simulate physical assembly seams.
*   **The Substrates**: We do not use generic CSS backgrounds. We use defined materials:
    *   `Molded Polymer`: Subtle noise + matte finish for containers.
    *   `Analyzed Glass`: High-gloss, refractive overlays for data views.
    *   `Technical Grid`: 24px/120px ISO drafting grids. **Usage Rule**: This is ALWAYS the bottom-most layer. Surfaces and components sit *on top* of the grid. It is used in reports, help sections, and landing pages to break visual monotony and imply precision engineering.

### **Axiom 2: Color as Signal**
We strictly limit color to functional signaling. There are no "brand colors" for decoration.
*   **Neutral Foundation**: A scale of **"Lufthansa Greys"** (`--rs-gray-50` to `--rs-gray-900`) defines structure.
*   **Vivid Signal (`#FF4F00`)**: Usage is restricted to **alert, error, or active-state** only. It is the "power on" light or the "critical failure" warning.
*   **Safe Green (`#006742`)**: Used exclusively for verification success (e.g., C2PA Verified).
*   **System Blue (`#005F87`)**: Used for data streams and non-critical information.

### **Axiom 3: Surgical Z-Axis (Physics)**
Shadows are not for "floating" but for defining **depth and recess**.
*   **L1 (Recess)**: `inset` shadows used for screens, wells, and data inputs (`--rs-shadow-l1`).
*   **L2 (Surface)**: Tight, sharp shadows for buttons and controls sitting *on* the chassis (`--rs-shadow-l2`).
*   **L3 (Lift)**: Reserved for floating modals or distinct physical layers (`--rs-shadow-l3`).
*   **Rule**: Shadows must never be "fluffy." They must look generated by a single, harsh light source (Top-Left).

## 2. Component Physics (The "Feel")

### **The Input**
*   **Levers, Not Toggles**: We replace abstract iOS-style toggles with physical **Levers** and **Rocker Switches** that have a clear "throw" action.
*   **Knobs (Rotary)**: Used for analog adjustments (gain, threshold) to simulate friction and resistance.
*   **Keys**: Buttons are "keys" with a tactile press-state (`active:scale-[0.98]`) and a deep travel feel.

### **The Feedback**
*   **Micro-Animation**: Transitions are instant (mechanical snap) or deliberate (analog needle drift). No "bouncy" spring physics unless simulating a physical gauge.
*   **Etched Typography**: Labels use `text-shadow: 0px 1px 0px rgba(255,255,255,0.8)` to appear engraved into the chassis.

## 3. Typography: "Precision Clarity"
Text is treated as functional marking on the chassis. We use a "Cinematic Typography" scale defined in `globals.css`:

| Role | Token Class | Logic / Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Headline** | `.rs-header-bold-italic` | **H1 (96px)**. Heavy, Italic, Tight. Used for major section breaks or dramatic statements. |
| **Display** | `.rs-type-display` | **H2 (48px)**. Black weight, Uppercase. High-impact visibility for active states. |
| **Section** | `.rs-type-section` | **H3 (24px)**. Bold, standard tracking. Used for component headers (e.g., "ANALYSIS REPORT"). |
| **Label** | `.rs-type-label` | **Control Labels (12px)**. Bold, Uppercase, Medium tracking. "Part numbers" or input labels. |
| **Micro** | `.rs-type-micro` | **Metadata (10px)**. Monospace, Uppercase, Wide tracking (`0.1em`). Used for status codes, timestamps. |
| **Body** | `.rs-type-body` | **Reading Text**. Inter Regular. Clean, legible, neutral. |
| **Data** | `.rs-type-mono` | **Raw Data**. JetBrains Mono. Unstyled, honest data presentation. |

**Key Rule**: Labels are often "Etched" using the `.rs-etched` utility to simulate physical engraving.

## 4. Implementation Rules (The Code)
*   **Never** use raw Tailwind colors (e.g., `bg-red-500`). Always use tokens: `bg-[var(--rs-signal)]`.
*   **Never** use default borders. Use `border-[var(--rs-border-primary)]` for seams or `border-[var(--rs-border-strong)]` for distinct edges.
*   **Always** wrap functional groups in an `RSPanel` or `RSCard` to establish the chassis layer.

## 5. Workflow: AI & The Design Lab
**"AI Dev as a Superpower"** means we move fast but break nothing. We use the **Design Lab** (`/dashboard/design-lab`) as our proving ground.

### **The Protocol**
1.  **Check First**: Before building, check the Design Lab to see if the component exists in the "Components" tab.
2.  **Build in Isolation**: If creating a complex new mechanism (e.g., a "Risk Radar"), build it as a standalone component in the Design Lab first.
3.  **Verify Physics**: Ensure the component feels "physical" (correct shadows, state changes) in the lab environment before integrating it into real pages.
4.  **Reference the Spec**: Use the token list below. Do not "eyeball" colors.

## 6. Design Token Reference (The MOMA_SPEC)

### **A. Material Palette (Industrial Finishes)**
| Token | Hex Value | Usage / Material Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--rs-white` | `#EBE7E0` | **Clay White**. The main structural chassis (ABS Plastic). Not pure white. |
| `--rs-gray-50` | `#E5E1DA` | **Recessed Well**. Used for backgrounds of grouping containers. |
| `--rs-gray-100` | `#DBD7D0` | **Element Surface**. Buttons, cards, and raised elements. |
| `--rs-gray-400` | `#9A9691` | **Lufthansa Grey**. Secondary text, inactive states, "printed" markings. |
| `--rs-gray-900` | `#1A1A1A` | **Carbon Matte**. Primary text, deep contrast elements. |
| `--rs-signal` | `#FF4F00` | **Vivid Signal**. CRITICAL / EMERGENCY / ACTIVE ONLY. |
| `--rs-safe` | `#006742` | **Safe Green**. Verified / Secure / Go. |
| `--rs-info` | `#005F87` | **System Blue**. Information / Data Stream / Neutral. |

### **B. Shadow Physics (Z-Axis)**
